Description

This Python script takes a set of points as input, computes the nearest neighbor for each point, and visualizes the connections using Matplotlib. The nearest neighbor for each point is determined using the Euclidean distance formula.

Requirements

Python 3.x

Matplotlib

NumPy

Example Input

Enter number of points: 5
Enter x and y coordinates: 1 1
Enter x and y coordinates: 2 2
Enter x and y coordinates: 3 3
Enter x and y coordinates: 5 5
Enter x and y coordinates: 6 6

Output

A Matplotlib visualization showing the points and their nearest neighbor connections.
